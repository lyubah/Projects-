From UCB CS188, 
Implemented various machine learning algorithms to create a pacman with a will to live. 
Specifically, sucessfully implemented a ML to pacman using algorithms such as: 
Breadth First Search, A* search, uniform cost search. 

Improved project using multi-agent searches: 
Design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. 
Implemented both minimax and expectimax search and designed a evaluation function.
