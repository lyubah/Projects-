SPAM/HAM EMAIL CLASSIFIER: 


Created a classifier that can distinguish spam emails from ham (non-spam) emails.
Here, I gained experience with feature engineering using text data and gained experiencing using sklearn libraries to process data and fit and train, my logistic regression models.
I validated the performance of my models and minimized both overfitting and underfitting, by generating and analyzing precision-recall curves 
In the second piece of the project, I evaluated my classifier and improved my model by 14% by looking at the length, puntutation, and "emotional" words through EDA.
